/**
 * This example shows you how to log what jclouds is doing. This is extremely useful for debugging, submitting bug
 * reports, getting help, and figuring exactly what the HTTP requests and resonses look like.
 * 
 * In this example we use the Simple Logging Facade for Java (SLF4J). The implementation of SLF4J that we'll use is
 * Logback so you'll need to download the Logback JARs from http://logback.qos.ch/download.html and put them on your
 * classpath.
 * 
 * The last key ingredient is the file /jclouds-examples/rackspace/src/main/resources/logback.xml which configures
 * the logging. As it is configured right now it will log wire input/output and headers to standard out (STDOUT).
 * This means that you will be able to see on your console everything that is sent in the request (marked by ">>")
 * and everything received in the response (marked by "<<").
